# Opening a PR

Firstly all contributions are welcome!

There is no change too small for us to accept and minor formatting, consistency and documentation PRs are very welcome! However, before making any large or structural changes it is recommended to seek feedback (preferably by reaching out in our community slack) to prevent wasted time and effort. We may already be working on a solution, or have a different direction we would like to take.

If you are ever unsure please just reach out, we are more than happy to guide you in the right direction!

## Considerations

As a general rule, the smaller the PR the quicker it's merged - as such when upgrading an SDK and introducing new properties we'd ask that you split that into multiple smaller PR's, for example if you were planning on updating an SDK to add a new resource and update an existing one we would prefer `3` separate PRs:

1. Update the Cosmos DB SDK to use API Version `2022-02-02` from `2020-01-01`.
2. Add the new property `new_feature` to the `azurerm_cosmosdb_*` resources.
3. Introduce the New Resource `azurerm_cosmosdb_resource`.

We also recommend not opening a PR based on your `main` branch. By doing this any changed pushed to the PR may inadvertently be also pushed to your `main` branch without warning.

## Process

Pull Requests generally go through a number of phrases which vary slightly depending on what's being changed.

The following guides cover the more common scenarios we see:

* [Extending an existing Resource](guide-new-fields-to-resource.md)
* [Extending an existing Data Source](guide-new-fields-to-data-source.md)
* [Adding a new Resource](guide-new-resource.md)
* [Adding a new Data Source](guide-new-data-source.md)
* [Adding a new Service Package](guide-new-service-package.md)

In general, Pull Requests which add/change either code or SDK's go through the following steps:

1. Make / commit the changes.
2. Run GitHub Actions linting and checks locally with the make command `make pr-check`.
3. Run all relevant [Acceptance Tests](running-the-tests.md).
4. Open a Pull Request (see below on `What makes a good PR?`).
5. GitHub actions will trigger and run all linters.
6. A Maintainer will review the PR and also run acceptance tests against our test subscription.
7. Once all comments have been addressed and tests pass the PR will be merged
8. The maintainer will update the CHANGELOG.md.

## What makes a good PR?

* Don't send the PR from your `main` branch.
* The PR Title is obvious/clear about what it's changing (see `Title` below).
* The PR Body contains a summary of what/why is included (see `Body` below).
* any linked Issues

### Title

The title of the PR should clearly state what the PR is doing, and ideally should match the entry that will end up in the changelog.

Examples of good PR titles:

- `azurerm_storage_management_policy - Mark rule.filters.blob_type as required`
- `azurerm_container_registry - support updating replications on demand`
- `azurerm_automation_account - support for the encrytion, local_authentication_enabled, and tags properties`
- `Data Source: azurerm_automation_account - prevent panic (#15474) by adding a nil check`
- `Upgrade bot API version from 2021-03-01 to 2021-05-01-preview`
- `New Resource: azurerm_managed_disk_sas_token`
- `New Data Source: azurerm_managed_disk_sas_token`
- `Docs: Fix wrong command in 3.0-upgrade-guide`

Examples of poorly written PR titles:

- `fix sql bug`
- `fixes #1234`
- `new resource`
- `upgrade sdk`
- `upgrade compute api`
- `add cosmos property`
- `support encryption, local_authentication_enabled properties`

### Description

A PR should include a brief description of the reason for the PR, what it is doing, what it is trying to accomplish, and anything relevant for a reviewer to know. It also helps to paste the output from running the accpetance tests.

It should also link to any related issues/PRs and include the following for any issues that it will resolve:

 ```
 fixes #1234,#5678
 ```
