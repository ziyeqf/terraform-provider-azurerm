Failover priority values must be unique for each of the regions in which the database account exists. Changing this causes the location to be re-provisioned and cannot be changed for the location with failover priority `0`.
* `zone_redundant` - (Optional) Should zone redundancy be enabled for this region? Defaults to `false`.

---

`capabilities` Configures the capabilities to enable for this Cosmos DB account:

* `name` - (Required) The capability to enable - Possible values are `AllowSelfServeUpgradeToMongo36`, `DisableRateLimitingResponses`, `EnableAggregationPipeline`, `EnableCassandra`, `EnableGremlin`, `EnableMongo`, `EnableTable`, `EnableServerless`, `MongoDBv3.4` and `mongoEnableDocLevelTTL`.

The example is `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/locations/{location}/restorableDatabaseAccounts/{restorableDatabaseAccountName}`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

**NOTE:** Any database account with `Continuous` type (live account or accounts deleted in last 30 days) are the restorable database accounts and there cannot be Create/Update/Delete operations on the restorable database accounts. They can only be read and be retrieved by `azurerm_cosmosdb_restorable_database_accounts`.
