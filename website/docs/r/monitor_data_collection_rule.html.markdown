## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `data_flow` - (Required) One or more `data_flow` blocks as defined below.

* `destinations` - (Required) A `destinations` block as defined below.

* `location` - (Required) The Azure Region where the Data Collection Rule should exist. Changing this forces a new Data Collection Rule to be created.

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this Data Collection Rule. Changing this forces a new Data Collection Rule to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the Resource Group where the Data Collection Rule should exist. Changing this forces a new Data Collection Rule to be created.

---

* `data_sources` - (Optional) A `data_sources` block as defined below. This property is optional and can be omitted if the rule is meant to be used via direct calls to the provisioned endpoint.

* `description` - (Optional) The description of the Data Collection Rule.

* `kind` - (Optional) The kind of the Data Collection Rule. Possible values are `Linux` and `Windows`. A rule of kind `Linux` does not allow for `windows_event_log` data sources. And a rule of kind `Windows` does not allow for `syslog` data sources. If kind is not specified, all kinds of data sources are allowed.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags which should be assigned to the Data Collection Rule.

---

A `azure_monitor_metrics` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this destination. This name should be unique across all destinations regardless of type within the Data Collection Rule.

---

A `data_flow` block supports the following:

* `destinations` - (Required) Specifies a list of destination names. A `azure_monitor_metrics` data source only allows for stream of kind `Microsoft-InsightsMetrics`.

* `streams` - (Required) Specifies a list of streams. Possible values are `Microsoft-Event`, `Microsoft-InsightsMetrics`, `Microsoft-Perf`, `Microsoft-Syslog`,and `Microsoft-WindowsEvent`.

---

A `data_sources` block supports the following:

* `extension` - (Optional) One or more `extension` blocks as defined below.

* `performance_counter` - (Optional) One or more `performance_counter` blocks as defined below.

* `syslog` - (Optional) One or more `syslog` blocks as defined below.

* `windows_event_log` - (Optional) One or more `windows_event_log` blocks as defined below.

---

A `destinations` block supports the following:

* `azure_monitor_metrics` - (Optional) A `azure_monitor_metrics` block as defined above.

* `log_analytics` - (Optional) One or more `log_analytics` blocks as defined below.

-> **NOTE** At least one of `azure_monitor_metrics` and `log_analytics` blocks must be specified.

---

A `extension` block supports the following:

* `extension_name` - (Required) The name of the VM extension.

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this data source. This name should be unique across all data sources regardless of type within the Data Collection Rule.

* `streams` - (Required) Specifies a list of streams that this data source will be sent to. A stream indicates what schema will be used for this data and usually what table in Log Analytics the data will be sent to. Possible values are `Microsoft-Event`, `Microsoft-InsightsMetrics`, `Microsoft-Perf`, `Microsoft-Syslog`,and `Microsoft-WindowsEvent`.

* `extension_json` - (Optional) A JSON String which specifies the extension setting.

* `input_data_sources` - (Optional) Specifies a list of data sources this extension needs data from. An item should be a name of a supported data source which produces only one stream. Supported data sources type: `performance_counter`, `windows_event_log`,and `syslog`.

---

A `log_analytics` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this destination. This name should be unique across all destinations regardless of type within the Data Collection Rule.

* `streams` - (Required) Specifies a list of streams that this data source will be sent to. A stream indicates what schema will be used for this data and usually what table in Log Analytics the data will be sent to. Possible values are `Microsoft-InsightsMetrics`,and `Microsoft-Perf`.

---

A `syslog` block supports the following:

* `facility_names` - (Required) Specifies a list of facility names. Use a wildcard `*` to collect logs for all facility names. Possible values are `auth`, `authpriv`, `cron`, `daemon`, `kern`, `lpr`, `mail`, `mark`, `news`, `syslog`, `user`, `uucp`, `local0`, `local1`, `local2`, `local3`, `local4`, `local5`, `local6`, `local7`,and `*`.

---

A `windows_event_log` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this data source. This name should be unique across all data sources regardless of type within the Data Collection Rule.

* `streams` - (Required) Specifies a list of streams that this data source will be sent to. A stream indicates what schema will be used for this data and usually what table in Log Analytics the data will be sent to. Possible values are `Microsoft-Event`,and `Microsoft-WindowsEvent`.

* `x_path_queries` - (Required) Specifies a list of Windows Event Log queries in XPath expression.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported: 

* `id` - The ID of the Data Collection Rule.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Data Collection Rule.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Data Collection Rule.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Data Collection Rule.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Data Collection Rule.

## Import

Data Collection Rules can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_monitor_data_collection_rule.example /subscriptions/12345678-1234-9876-4563-123456789012/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionRules/rule1
