Manages an Azure App Configuration Feature.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_app_configuration" "appconf" {
  name                = "appConf1"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
}

resource "azurerm_app_configuration_feature" "test" {
  configuration_store_id = azurerm_app_configuration.appconf.id
  description            = "test description"
  name                   = "acctest-ackey-%d"
  label                  = "acctest-ackeylabel-%d"
  enabled                = true
}
```

* `enabled` - (Optional) The status of the App Configuration Feature. By default, this is set to false.

* `label` - (Optional) The label of the App Configuration Feature. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `locked` - (Optional) Should this App Configuration Feature be Locked to prevent changes?

* `name` - (Required) The name of the App Configuration Feature. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `percentage_filter_value` - (Optional) A list of one or more numbers representing the value of the percentage required to enable this feature.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

* `targeting_filter` - (Optional) A `targeting_filter` block as defined below.

* `timewindow_filter` - (Optional) A `timewindow_filter` block as defined below.

---

A `targeting_filter` block represents a feature filter of type `Microsoft.Targeting` and takes the following attributes:

* `default_rollout_percentage` - (Required) A number representing the percentage of the entire user base.

* `groups` - (Optional) One or more blocks of type `groups` as defined below.

* `users` - (Optional) A list of users to target for this feature.

* `id` - The App Configuration Feature ID.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 45 minutes) Used when creating the App Configuration Feature.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the App Configuration Feature.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the App Configuration Feature.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the App Configuration Feature.

## Import

App Configuration Features can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_app_configuration_feature.test /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resourceGroup1/providers/Microsoft.AppConfiguration/configurationStores/appConf1/AppConfigurationFeature/appConfFeature1/Label/label1
```

If you wish to import a key with an empty label then sustitute the label's name with `%00`, like this:

```shell
terraform import azurerm_app_configuration_feature.test /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resourceGroup1/providers/Microsoft.AppConfiguration/configurationStores/appConf1/AppConfigurationFeature/appConfFeature1/Label/%00
```
