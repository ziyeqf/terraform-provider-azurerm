# azurerm_mobile_network_packet_core_control_plane

Get information about a Mobile Network Packet Core Control Plane.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "azurerm_mobile_network_packet_core_control_plane" "example" {
  name                = "example-mnpccp"
  resource_group_name = "example-rg"
}
```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name which should be used for this Mobile Network Packet Core Control Plane. Changing this forces a new Mobile Network Packet Core Control Plane to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Resource Group where the Mobile Network Packet Core Control Plane should exist. Changing this forces a new Mobile Network Packet Core Control Plane to be created.

---

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Mobile Network Packet Core Control Plane.

* `identity` - An `identity` block as defined below.

* `location` - The Azure Region where the Mobile Network Packet Core Control Plane should exist. 

* `site_ids` - A list of IDs of Mobile Network Sites in which this packet core control plane should be deployed.

* `sku` - The SKU defining the throughput and SIM allowances for this packet core control plane deployment. 

* `local_diagnostics_access_setting` - One or more `local_diagnostics_access_setting` block as defined below. The kubernetes ingress configuration to control access to packet core diagnostics over local APIs.

* `control_plane_access_interface` - A `control_plane_access_interface` block as defined below. The control plane interface on the access network. For 5G networks, this is the N2 interface. For 4G networks, this is the S1-MME interface.

* `user_equipment_mtu_in_bytes` - the MTU (in bytes) signaled to the UE. The same MTU is set on the user plane data links for all data networks. The MTU set on the user plane access link is calculated to be 60 bytes greater than this value to allow for GTP encapsulation.

* `core_network_technology` - The core network technology generation.

* `platform` - A `platform` block as defined below.

* `identity` - An `identity` block as defined below.

* `interop_settings` - Settings to allow interoperability with third party components e.g. RANs and UEs.

* `tags` - A mapping of tags which should be assigned to the Mobile Network Packet Core Control Plane.

* `version` - The version of the packet core software that is deployed.

---

A `control_plane_access_interface` block supports the following:

* `name` - The logical name for this interface.

* `ipv4_address` - The IPv4 address.

* `ipv4_subnet` - The IPv4 subnet.

* `ipv4_gateway` - The default IPv4 gateway (router).

---

A `local_diagnostics_access_setting` block supports the following:

* `authentication_type` - How to authenticate users who access local diagnostics APIs. 

* `https_server_certificate_url` - A versionless certificate URL, which used to secure local access to packet core diagnostics over local APIs by the kubernetes ingress.

---

An `identity` block supports the following:

* `type` - The type of Managed Service Identity.

* `identity_ids` - A list of IDs for User Assigned Managed Identity resources to be assigned.

---

A `platform` block supports the following:

* `type` - The platform type where packet core is deployed.

* `edge_device_id` - The ID of Azure Stack Edge device where the packet core is deployed. If the device is part of a fault tolerant pair, either device in the pair can be specified.

* `azure_arc_connected_cluster_id` - The ID of Azure Arc connected cluster where the packet core is deployed.

* `azure_stack_hci_cluster_id` - The ID of Azure Stack HCI clusterwhere the packet core is deployed.

* `custom_location_id` -  The ID of Azure Arc custom location where the packet core is deployed.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Mobile Network Packet Core Control Plane.

## Import

Mobile Network Packet Core Control Plane can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.
